# Prerequisites
You need to have an account at https://app.okdokument.com and a valid API key generated by the *OK dokument* service.  

# Supported Operations

## 1. Document Upload
Action used for uploading a PDF file to the document signature service. This action takes a base64 string and uploads it to the *OK dokument*  API platform.  

Document passes several states during its lifetime. OK dokument API uses the following
document states:
- tags – state that searches text tags and inserts signature acrofields. After successful insertion of acrofields it automatically changes state to tosign
- tostamp – state that insert digital stamp into the document
- tosign – document ready to be signed
- signed – signed document (within given signatureRequestID)
- errorsendinfo – error while calling info service
- canceled – canceled document – signer pressed the “Cancel” button in the document

#### Signature acrofields
Acrofield is a type of active field supported in PDF. A signature acrofield is a special type of active field that allows a signature to be inserted into a document at a fixed location.
Acrofields can be inserted into PDFs with specialized PDF tools such as Adobe PRO, or with template tools such as JasperReport.
#### Tags
A tag represents a unique text value that the API server scans. If it finds it, it inserts the
signature acrofield in its place. The tag lookup is provided by the "tags" document state,
which must be set when the JSON/document service is called.
OKdokument API supports the following tags for optional signature:

` _SO1_`
`_SO2_`
`_SO3_ `
`_SO4_`
`_SO5_`

OKdokument API supports the following tags for mandatory signature:
` _SC1_`
`_SC2_`
`_SC3_ `
`_SC4_`
`_SC5_`

If mandatory tags are used, all visible mandatory signature acrofields must signed before
submitting the document.

In case it is not possible to prepare documents with signature acrofields or tags when
registering signatureRequest, it is possible to enable "sign anywhere" functionality, which
will allow the user to sign the document at any location, simple where the user clicks/taps
#### Convert document to PDF
OKdokument API supports conversion of .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx into PDF file format. The source file can contain also tags, OKdokument API will first do the file conversion and then automatically inserts signature acrofields.

To convert file into PDF you must fill name of the document. This parameter is mandatory if you want to do the file conversion to PDF format. For conversion the file postfix must be:
- contract.doc
- contract.docx
-  contract.xls
- contract.xlsx

#### Storing and deleting documents
OK dokument API does not serve the role of a permanent archive of signed document.
Following rules are applied:
1. Signed document is automatically deleted 10 days after signing
2. Unsigned document is automatically deleted after 30 days after uploading

## 2. Signature Request
This action is used for generating signature request ID. Within this action you have to use Document ID. The Document ID is a result from Document upload action.  
In this action you can transform your signature process into a multistage signature process. Adding additional parameter "Signature fields" allows you to manage what should be available in each signature request. You can use acrofields with internal names

` _SO1_`
`_SO2_`
`_SO3_ `
`_SO4_`
`_SO5_`

OR

` _SC1_`
`_SC2_`
`_SC3_ `
`_SC4_`
`_SC5_`

This action can be used multiple times in your process. Signature request action is generated in *OK dokument* service as "Signature request" and this ID is unique for every "Sign" action. 

To send request for document signature you use response attribute URL and use it in email, push notification or MS Teams to ask someone to sign specific document.

Once document is signed you can use “Signature request” to change the document state to “tosign” and create new signatureRequestId and prepare the document for next signature. Than the process repeats steps 3 – 5.
